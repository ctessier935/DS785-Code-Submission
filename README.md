# DS785-Code-Submission
Final code for UWEX DS785 Capstone course.

For my code, it is broken into three sections. The first section of code is the SQL code used to join the three tables loan master, collateral relationship, and collateral master in order to get a complete dataset based on the information contained in the banking system. I then go on to loop through the table to find the columns that only have one distinct value contained in the variable to remove any filler columns. The next section is to create any needed statistics for presentation 3 and the final paper in order to gain a deeper understanding of the data that is available along with any relevant correlations between the target variable. While the last section is the final model code to create a classification model to predict the credit risk code for a borrower. This will be used to optimize the credit risk evaluation process and reduce risk in the banking process with any visuals that help support my finding and the business problem I have identified.
